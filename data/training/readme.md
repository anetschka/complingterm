This file describes the contents of this folder.

* classes_for_training.tsv: Original training file before manual relabelling, as output by the prepare_trainingfile.pl script. Numbers indicate the frequency of the assigned majority class in the manual ACL RD-TEC 2.0 annotation.
* classes_for_training_23nov.tsv: Result of a first relabeling step with more fine-grained class assignments. Share of "other" class has been notably reduced by this step (documents individually in file other:relabel.txt).
* classes_for_training_coarse.tsv: Gives the final training file for class assignments.
